722548854f6fc774b21c15319d144450.jpg|"The correct answer is **A**. Here's why:

The puzzle plays on the concept of displacement.  When an object is placed in water, it displaces a volume of water equal to its own volume.  The higher the water level, the greater the volume of the displaced water, therefore the greater the volume of the object submerged.

Let's analyze each glass:

* **A:** The scissors are partially submerged and displace a significant amount of water.  They are also fairly large and dense.

* **B:** The paperclip is very small and displaces very little water.

* **C:** The eraser is small and displaces a little more water than the paperclip, but considerably less than the scissors.

* **D:** The watch is relatively larger and more dense than the paperclip or eraser, but smaller and less dense than the scissors.

Because the scissors in glass A are significantly larger and displace more water than the objects in the other glasses, glass A has the most water in it."|

**1. Identify the dangers:** The image shows several potential hazards:

* **Open manholes:** Number 4 is positioned directly over an open manhole.
* **A rake:** Number 3 is about to trip over a rake.
* **A car:** Number 1 is in the path of an oncoming car.
* **A tree:** Number 2 is near a tree, but this doesn't pose an immediate threat.

**2. Assess the immediate risks:**  Each of the numbered individuals is facing a reasonably immediate danger.

**3. Consider timing/sequence:** The car is in motion and poses the most immediate threat to the person closest to it, which is person #1. However the rake is also very likely to cause someone to fall.  The manhole might result in serious injury, but it's less of an immediately dangerous situation.

**4. Determine the safest person:** Considering the immediate dangers, person #2 is the safest, because they are not in immediate danger from an oncoming vehicle, manhole, or the rake.

**Therefore, the answer is person number 2.**  They are the furthest from immediate danger."|

1. **Follow the Water:** The water flows from the tap directly into container number 1.

2. **Path of Least Resistance:** Water will always take the easiest route.  It will fill container 1 completely before overflowing into container 2.

3. **Sequential Filling:** Once container 1 is full, the water will then flow into container 2. The same principle applies to the subsequent containers.  The water will fill in order, following the path shown.

**Therefore, container number 1 will fill up first.**"|

**1. Visual Estimation:**

The image shows that teapot B is noticeably larger than teapot A.  It appears to be roughly double the height and width of teapot A.

**2. Volume Calculation (Approximation):**

Since volume scales with the cube of linear dimensions, if teapot B's dimensions are approximately double those of A, its volume will be roughly 2³ = 8 times greater.

**3.  Determining B's Capacity:**

Teapot A holds 32 cups of tea.  Therefore, teapot B, being approximately 8 times larger, would hold approximately 32 cups * 8 = 256 cups of tea.

**4. Answer:**

Teapot B holds approximately 256 cups of tea.  This is an estimation based on visual comparison and the relationship between linear dimensions and volume.  The actual capacity might be slightly different depending on the exact shapes of the teapots."|

1. **Analyze the Setup:** We have a series of events triggered by E pushing the stone. The stone's movement is the key to understanding the chain reaction.

2. **Trace the Chain Reaction:**
    * **E Pushes the Stone:** The initial action.
    * **Stone Rolls Down:**  The stone rolls down the ramp, impacting the seesaw at C.
    * **Seesaw Tilts:** The weight of the stone on one side of the seesaw causes it to tilt.
    * **D is Crushed:** The seesaw's tilting movement directly results in D being crushed.

3. **Conclusion:** The person who dies is **D**.

Therefore, the answer is **D**."|

Here's why:

1. **Gravitational Pull:** Gravity acts on all the people equally.  They are all hanging upside down and unsupported.

2. **Strength and Grip:** While we don't know their exact strength, it's clear the man in orange has a weaker grip and is already slipping. His body positioning also suggests a less secure hold compared to the others.  The woman in pink appears to have a better grip and more stable positioning.

3. **Imminent Fall:** The man in orange shows visible signs of already losing his grip; he's closer to falling than the others.  The rest have a relatively stronger and more stable grip.

Therefore, considering the visual clues of posture and grip strength, the man in the orange shirt is the most likely to fall first."|
c86efa5988bf5dbe024200d66e90f154.jpg|"Here's how to solve this puzzle:

1. **Follow the flow:**  The liquid pours from the bottle (at the top) into glass #1.

2. **Branching paths:** Glass #1 fills first.  Once glass #1 is full, the liquid flows into glass #2 and glass #3 simultaneously.

3. **Prioritization:** Because glass #1 fills first, and then flows equally to glass #2 and glass #3, neither glass #2 nor glass #3 will fill before the other.

4. **Further branches:** Once glass #2 and glass #3 are full, the liquid flows to glass #4, glass #5, glass #6, and glass #7.  However, the filling of glasses #4, #5, #6, and #7 happen only *after* glasses #2 and #3 are full.

**Therefore, the answer is glass #1.**  It's the only glass that fills before any others."|

1. **Starting Point:** The water flows from the tap into tank A.

2. **Tank A to B:** Tank A will fill first until it overflows.  The overflow from A will then flow directly into tank B.

3. **Tank B to C:** Once B is full, it overflows into tank C.

4. **Tank C to Others:** Tank C has an overflow that leads to multiple paths.  Let's examine these paths. The crucial point to note is that the design of the paths leading from C splits the flow.  One path leads to D, and the other path goes to J.  This is a key element for solving this.

5. **Simultaneous Filling:**  The water will simultaneously start filling tanks D and J. This is because of the split in paths from C.

6. **Determining First Fill from C's Overflow:**  Both D and J will fill at the same rate from C's overflow. Therefore, neither D nor J will fill before the other.

7. **Conclusion:** Tank B will fill after A and will then overflow to fill tank C. Tanks D and J will begin filling simultaneously after C fills, thus none of them is the first to fill after A, B, and C.  Therefore, the answer is **Tank B**."|

1. **Follow the path:**  Start at the teapot's spout and trace the path of the liquid.  The liquid flows down the central tube.

2. **Identify the branches:** Notice that the central tube splits into several branches.

3. **Order of filling:** The liquid will always fill the closest cup first along the tube.  It will fill cup number **4** before reaching any other cup because it's directly below the first branch of the pipe.

Therefore, the answer is **cup 4**."|

   * Then it flows into **H**.
   * Next, **I**.
   * And finally **J**.
   * Then it goes to **K** and **L**.

3. **The Answer:** Tank **A** will fill first because it's the first tank the water encounters.

Therefore, the solution is **A**."|

1. **Water Source:** The water flows from the tap (labeled 1).

2. **Initial Flow:**  The water initially splits into two paths, going to glasses 2 and 3.

3. **Glass 2 Fills First:**  Glass 2 is connected directly to the initial split from the tap. No other glasses feed into glass 2. Therefore, glass 2 begins to fill immediately.

4. **Other Glasses:** Glasses 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 will fill later, only after the initial water flow fills other, upstream glasses.  The order in which they fill after 2 depends on how much water can flow into and how quickly they fill, factors not provided in the picture.

**Therefore, the answer is Glass 2.**"|
optical-illusion-which-table-is-bigger_jpg.jpg|"Here's how to solve this brain teaser:

**1. Visualize the Tables:**  Imagine both tables laid flat on the ground.  The perspective in the drawing is making it tricky.  Both tables are drawn at an angle, so we need to correct that in our minds.

**2. Analyze the Dimensions:** To compare properly, we need to focus on the length and width of the tabletops.

* **Table A:** This table is long and narrow.  While its exact dimensions are not given, you can see it's significantly longer than it is wide.

* **Table B:** This table is more square-like or possibly a slightly elongated square (it's difficult to tell with the perspective provided). Although it might seem smaller, we have to account for the perspective.

**3. Account for Perspective:** The drawings are in perspective, making Table A appear larger, and its width looks less wide, than it would look from a head-on view.

**4. Consider the Area:**  The most reliable way to compare size is to think about the overall area of the tabletop. Table A's length compensates for its small width, whereas Table B has a more consistently sized surface area that would probably encompass a larger surface area despite it looking smaller in the image.

**5. Conclusion:** Without exact measurements, it's difficult to give a definitive answer.  However, due to perspective and the apparent area that each table covers, it's highly likely that **Table A is bigger** in terms of surface area.  The image is designed to be deceiving!"|
optical-illusions-with-answers_jpg_19.jpg|"Here's how to solve this brain teaser:

**1. Establish a Reference Point:**  The key is to find something in the image that provides a consistent size reference.  The flower boxes under window A and the plant pots next to window B serve this purpose.  We can assume these pots and boxes are roughly the same size.

**2. Compare the Windows Relative to the Reference Points:**

* **Window A:**  The window is approximately the same height as the flower box.

* **Window B:** The window is noticeably taller than the plant pots.  Since the pots are approximately the same size as the flower box, Window B is demonstrably taller than Window A.

**3. Conclusion:** Window B is bigger than Window A.  The difference in apparent size is due to perspective and the angle of the image, creating an optical illusion."|
