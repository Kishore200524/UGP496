**1. Find the value of a pair of shoes:**

* The first equation shows three pairs of shoes adding up to 30:  3 * Shoes = 30.
* Therefore, one pair of shoes equals 10 (30 / 3 = 10).

**2. Find the value of a boy:**

* The second equation shows two boys and a pair of shoes adding up to 20: 2 * Boy + Shoes = 20.
* Substitute the value of a pair of shoes (10): 2 * Boy + 10 = 20.
* Subtract 10 from both sides: 2 * Boy = 10.
* Therefore, one boy equals 5 (10 / 2 = 5).

**3. Find the value of a hamburger:**

* The third equation shows two pairs of hamburgers and a boy adding up to 13: 2 * Hamburger + Boy = 13.
* Substitute the value of a boy (5): 2 * Hamburger + 5 = 13.
* Subtract 5 from both sides: 2 * Hamburger = 8.
* Therefore, one hamburger equals 4 (8 / 2 = 4).

**4. Solve the final equation:**

* The final equation is: Shoes + Boy x Hamburger = ?
* Substitute the values we found: 10 + 5 x 4 = ?
* Following the order of operations (multiplication before addition): 10 + 20 = 30.

**1. Equation 2:  Toadstool x Bowser = 0**

* This tells us that either the Toadstool or Bowser has a value of 0.  Since we can't have a value of 0 for Bowser as other operations use it, the Toadstool (the mushroom) must equal 0.

**2. Equation 3: Mario ÷ Toadstool = 2**

*  Since the Toadstool is 0, this equation is undefined because we can't divide by zero. There must be a mistake in the provided question.  Let's assume that Equation 3 was written incorrectly and should have been Mario ÷ Toadstool = 2; therefore we can state that Mario = 2 * Toadstool

**3. Equation 1:  36 = Mario + Princess Peach + Mario**

* This will be a critical one in solving the overall question

**4.  Equation 4: Mario = Princess Peach**

* This directly tells us that Mario and Princess Peach have the same value.

**5. Solving for Mario and Peach:**

* Substituting equation 4 into equation 3, we get 36 = Mario + Mario + Mario, meaning 36 = 3 * Mario.
* Therefore, Mario = 36 / 3 = 12.
* Because Mario = Princess Peach, then Princess Peach = 12.

**6. The Final Equation:**

* The final equation is Mario + Bowser + Princess Peach + Toadstool = ?
* Substituting the values we found: 12 + Bowser + 12 + 0 = ?
* We still don't have a value for Bowser.

**Conclusion:**

The problem is fundamentally flawed with the division by 0.  If we were to disregard the second equation that has the division by zero, the answer to the final equation cannot be determined because we still lack the value of Bowser.  We can only calculate the value of Mario and Peach as 12."|

**1. Assign Variables:**

Let's represent the unknown numbers in the squares with variables:

* Top left square:  A
* Top right square: B
* Bottom left square: C
* Bottom right square: D

**2. Set up Equations:**

Based on the image, we can create the following equations:

* A + B = 8
* C + D = 13
* A + C = 6

**3. Solve the System of Equations:**

We have three equations and four unknowns.  That means we'll need to use some substitution and logic:

* **From A + B = 8:**  We can express B as B = 8 - A
* **From A + C = 6:** We can express C as C = 6 - A

Now substitute these expressions for B and C into the third equation (C + D = 13):

(6 - A) + D = 13

Solve for D:

D = 13 + A - 6
D = 7 + A

**4. Find a Solution:**

Notice that A, B, C, and D must be whole numbers. Since we have the equations A + B = 8 and A + C = 6, we can conclude that:

* A must be a whole number less than 6 (since A + C = 6 and C must be a positive number).
* It's likely A will be small because of the equations and the number 13 in the problem. Let's try some values of A to see if we get a consistent whole number answer for the rest of the variables.

Let's try A = 2:

* If A = 2, then B = 8 - 2 = 6
* If A = 2, then C = 6 - 2 = 4
* If A = 2, then D = 7 + 2 = 9

Now let's check if these values satisfy all three original equations:

* 2 + 6 = 8 (True)
* 4 + 9 = 13 (True)
* 2 + 4 = 6 (True)

All three equations are true!

**5. Solution:**

Therefore, the solution is:

**1. Find the weight of the rabbit:**

* The first image shows a cat and a rabbit weighing 10kg together.
* The second image shows a dog and a rabbit weighing 20kg together.

Let's use variables:

* Let 'c' represent the weight of the cat.
* Let 'r' represent the weight of the rabbit.
* Let 'd' represent the weight of the dog.

We can create two equations based on the first two images:

* Equation 1: c + r = 10kg
* Equation 2: d + r = 20kg

**2. Find the weight of the cat and dog together:**

* The third image shows the dog and the cat weighing 24kg together.  This gives us a third equation:

* Equation 3: d + c = 24kg

**3. Solve for the individual weights:**

Now we have a system of three equations with three unknowns. We can solve this using substitution or elimination.  Let's use elimination:

* Notice that Equation 1 and Equation 3 both contain 'c'.  Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3:

   (d + c) - (c + r) = 24kg - 10kg
   d - r = 14kg

* Now we have two equations with 'd' and 'r':

   d + r = 20kg
   d - r = 14kg

* Add these two equations together to eliminate 'r':

   (d + r) + (d - r) = 20kg + 14kg
   2d = 34kg
   d = 17kg  (The dog weighs 17kg)

* Substitute the value of 'd' back into Equation 2 to find 'r':

   17kg + r = 20kg
   r = 3kg (The rabbit weighs 3kg)

* Substitute the value of 'r' back into Equation 1 to find 'c':

   c + 3kg = 10kg
   c = 7kg (The cat weighs 7kg)


**4. Find the weight in the final image:**

The final image shows the cat and the rabbit together.  We know:

* c = 7kg
* r = 3kg

Therefore, the total weight in the final image is 7kg + 3kg = 10kg

**Answer:** The final image shows a weight of $\boxed{10kg}$"|

**1. Find the value of the sunflower:**

* Look at the third equation: Bee + Bee + Sunflower = 21
* We'll come back to this, as we need to find the value of the bee first.

**2. Find the value of the bee:**

* Look at the first equation: Sunflower + Sunflower + Butterfly = 19
* Let's use the variable 's' for sunflower and 'b' for butterfly.  This becomes:  s + s + b = 19 or 2s + b = 19

**3. Find the value of the butterfly:**

* Look at the second equation: Butterfly + Sunflower x Butterfly = 27
*  Using variables, this is: b + s x b = 27

**4. Solve the system of equations:**

* We have two equations with two unknowns ('s' and 'b'):
    * 2s + b = 19
    * b + sb = 27

* Let's solve for 'b' in the first equation:  b = 19 - 2s
* Substitute this value of 'b' into the second equation: (19 - 2s) + s(19 - 2s) = 27
* Simplify and solve for 's': 19 - 2s + 19s - 2s² = 27
* Rearrange into a quadratic equation: 2s² - 17s + 8 = 0
* Factor the quadratic equation: (2s - 1)(s - 8) = 0
* This gives two possible solutions for 's': s = 1/2 or s = 8.  Since we're dealing with whole numbers representing images, **s = 8** (the sunflower's value).

* Substitute s = 8 back into b = 19 - 2s: b = 19 - 2(8) = 3.  Therefore, the **butterfly's value is 3**.

**5. Find the value of the bee:**

* Now, use the third equation: Bee + Bee + Sunflower = 21
* This is: 2Bee + 8 = 21
* Solve for the bee: 2Bee = 13, Bee = 6.5. Since we cannot have half a bee, there must be a mistake somewhere. Let's check the steps again. There is indeed a mistake in assuming the butterfly is always 3.
* Let's use the second equation: Butterfly + Sunflower x Butterfly = 27. If the sunflower is 8, then Butterfly + 8 x Butterfly = 27. This gives 9 Butterfly = 27, so Butterfly = 3. However, this is only true if the multiplication happens before the addition.  If we are following order of operations, it should be: Butterfly + (Sunflower * Butterfly) = 27. This gives 3 + (8*3) = 27 which is incorrect.
* Let's assume that the multiplication in equation 2 is not standard mathematical multiplication. The Sunflower value is 8, then this means the Butterfly is 3. 


**6. Solve the final equation:**

* The final equation is: Sunflower + Bee x Sunflower = ?
* Substituting the values we found: 8 + 6.5 x 8 = ?
* This gives: 8 + 52 = 60

**1. Define Variables:**

Let's represent the unknown numbers in the boxes with variables:

* Top left box = A
* Top right box = B
* Bottom left box = C
* Bottom right box = D

**2. Set up Equations:**

Based on the image, we can create two equations:

* Equation 1: A - B = 9
* Equation 2: C - D = 14

We also know from the image that:

* C = 12
* D = 2

**3. Solve for A and B:**

Substitute the values of C and D into Equation 2:

12 - 2 = 14  (This is incorrect, there's a mistake in the problem statement; it should be 12 + 2 = 14)

Let's assume the symbol between the bottom boxes is addition ( + ) instead of subtraction ( - ) and solve accordingly.

Corrected Equation 2: C + D = 14

Now, substitute the values: 12 + 2 = 14 which is correct.

Now, let's solve for A and B.  We still have:

A - B = 9

We need more information.  Let's examine potential relationships between the top and bottom rows. One possible relationship is that the numbers in the boxes are related vertically.  If we add 12 and 2 we get 14. We also have this relationship: A + B = 14.

**4. Solve the System of Equations:**

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

* A - B = 9
* A + B = 14

We can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Add the two equations together:

2A = 23

A = 11.5

Now substitute A back into either equation to solve for B:

11.5 + B = 14

B = 2.5

**5. Solution:**

Therefore, the solution ( assuming the bottom operation is addition instead of subtraction) is:

* A = 11.5
* B = 2.5
* C = 12
* D = 2


**Conclusion:** The puzzle has a flaw in it's original presentation. The bottom row should use addition (+) not subtraction (-) for it to be solvable.  With that correction, we get the solution above.  There may be other interpretations depending on the intended relationship between the top and bottom rows."|

Let's represent the shapes with variables:

* Circle (orange) =  `C`
* Triangle (pink) = `T`
* Star (purple) = `S`
* Square (brown) = `Q`

**2. Rewrite the Equations:**

Now we can rewrite the given equations using our variables:

* C + T = 8  (Equation 1)
* S - Q = Q  (Equation 2)
* C - T = 4  (Equation 3)
* Q + S = 12 (Equation 4)

**3. Solve for the Variables:**

Let's solve this system of equations.  Notice that Equations 1 and 3 are a simple system that we can solve using elimination:

* Add Equation 1 and Equation 3 together: (C + T) + (C - T) = 8 + 4  => 2C = 12  => C = 6

Now substitute C = 6 back into Equation 1:

* 6 + T = 8 => T = 2

Now use Equation 4:

* Q + S = 12

And Equation 2:

* S - Q = Q  => S = 2Q

Substitute S = 2Q into Equation 4:

* Q + 2Q = 12  => 3Q = 12  => Q = 4

Finally, substitute Q = 4 back into S = 2Q:

* S = 2 * 4 = 8

**4. Solve the Final Equation:**

We now have values for all our variables: C = 6, T = 2, S = 8, Q = 4. Let's substitute these into the final equation:

T + C - S + Q = ?

2 + 6 - 8 + 4 = 4

**1. Find the value of the soda:**

* The first equation shows three sodas adding up to 75: Soda + Soda + Soda = 75
* Dividing both sides by 3 gives us: Soda = 25

**2. Find the value of the grapefruit slice:**

* The second equation is: Soda + Grapefruit × Grapefruit = 89
* We know Soda = 25, so substitute this value: 25 + Grapefruit × Grapefruit = 89
* Subtract 25 from both sides: Grapefruit × Grapefruit = 64
* Take the square root of both sides: Grapefruit = 8

**3. Find the value of the plate:**

* The third equation is: Plate + Plate + Plate = 44
* Dividing both sides by 3 gives us: Plate = 44/3 = 14.666...  This is unusual for a math puzzle. This may be an issue with the puzzle itself.

**Assuming that we should treat plates as whole numbers**
Let's try an alternative approach to solving this part.
Let's assume the image's representation of the puzzle is not clear. Perhaps the + and x signs were misrepresented.

If we assume instead that the second equation was a sum and the third equation was a multiplication, then these equations may be solved.
If we assume the second equation is Soda + Grapefruit + Grapefruit = 89, then 25 + 2 * Grapefruit = 89, so 2 * Grapefruit = 64, and Grapefruit = 32.
If we assume the third equation is Plate * Plate * Plate = 44, then there is no easy whole number solution. If the equation was intended to be Plate + Plate + Plate = 44, then the value of Plate is 14.666...  Let's consider the puzzle may be flawed, or have a slight inaccuracy in its design.

**4. Solve for the final equation:**

Now we'll solve the final equation. There is a reasonable solution using our values only if we are correct in our assessment of the original puzzle's errors.

If we use: Soda = 25, Grapefruit = 8, Plate = 14.666... , then the answer is not a whole number and would not seem a reasonable answer for a brain teaser puzzle.

However, if we instead use the alternative values found by assuming a misrepresented puzzle: Soda = 25, Grapefruit = 32, Plate = 14.666..., then the equation would be:
25 + 32 * 14.666... = ?
Which would not be an integer result and therefore incorrect as a solution.



**Conclusion:**

There seems to be an inconsistency or error in the puzzle's design in the depiction of the final equation. The solution to this puzzle, as presented, requires non-integer values for the plate, which isn't typical for these types of puzzles.  It's likely the puzzle-maker intended for a different arrangement of the operations or values."|

* The equation ""Pig - Bird = 99kg""  will be solved later.  We need the pig's weight first.
* The equation ""Bird + Rabbit = 5kg"" tells us that a bird plus a rabbit (4kg) equals 5kg.
* Subtracting the rabbit's weight, we find that one bird weighs 5kg - 4kg = 1kg.

**3. Find the weight of the pig:**

* Now we can solve ""Pig - Bird = 99kg"".
* Substitute the bird's weight: Pig - 1kg = 99kg
* Add 1kg to both sides: Pig = 100kg

**4. Solve the final equation:**

* The final equation is ""Bird + Pig + Rabbit = ???""
* Substitute the weights we found: 1kg + 100kg + 4kg = 105kg

**1. Find the value of the red triangle:**

* The first equation shows three red triangles adding up to 20:  Red + Red + Red = 20
* Therefore, one red triangle is worth 20 / 3 = 6.67 (approximately).  Since we're dealing with whole numbers, there must be rounding occurring or a different interpretation.

**2. Find the value of the blue triangle:**

* The second equation is: Red + Red + 3 = Blue
* Substituting the approximate value of the red triangle: 6.67 + 6.67 + 3 = 16.34.  Again, a non-whole number suggests an alternative approach.

**3. Find the value of the yellow triangle:**

* The third equation is: Red + Yellow + Red = 21
*  Let's assume that there's a whole number solution. If one red triangle is worth 'x', then 2x + yellow = 21.

**4. Re-examine the equations:**

Let's reconsider the initial assumptions.  The use of different colored triangles strongly suggests that the triangles themselves have no inherent value.  Instead, the *position* of the triangle might be key. Let's try assigning variables:

* Let's call the red triangle 'A', the blue triangle 'B', and the yellow triangle 'C'.

Now rewrite the equations:

* Equation 1: A + A + A = 20  (This implies that each 'A' could be 6.66..., but we are assuming whole numbers so there must be more to this)
* Equation 2: A + A + 3 = B
* Equation 3: A + C + A = 21

**5. Solve for the variables using the whole number constraint:**

Equation 1: 3A = 20. This is not possible if A must be a whole number. Let's look at Equation 3 instead:

Equation 3: 2A + C = 21.  We need to find whole numbers for A and C that satisfy this.  Let's try different values for A.

*If A = 7, then 2(7) + C = 21, which means C = 7.*

Let's check if this works with Equation 2:

Equation 2: A + A + 3 = B, substituting A = 7, we get 7 + 7 + 3 = B, so B = 17.

**6. Solve the final equation:**

The final equation is: A + B x C = ?

Substituting the values we found: 7 + 17 x 7 = 7 + 119 = 126

**Therefore, the solution is 126**"|

**3. Find the value of the black star:**

* Substitute the values of the red star (3) and blue star (9) into the first row equation: 3 + 7 + 9 = (black star)

Let's use variables:

* Let 'C' represent the weight of the cat.
* Let 'D' represent the weight of the dog.
* Let 'R' represent the weight of the rabbit.

Now we have these equations:

* C + D = 24  (Equation 1)
* C + R = 10  (Equation 2)
* D + R = 20  (Equation 3)

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:

**Step 1: Find the weight of the rabbit.**

* The first image shows a cat and a rabbit weighing 10kg together.
* The second image shows a dog and a rabbit weighing 20kg together.

Let's use variables:

* Let 'c' represent the weight of the cat.
* Let 'r' represent the weight of the rabbit.
* Let 'd' represent the weight of the dog.


We can create two equations:

* Equation 1: c + r = 10kg
* Equation 2: d + r = 20kg

**Step 2: Find the weight of the cat.**

The third image shows the cat and dog together weighing 24kg.  This gives us a third equation:

* Equation 3: c + d = 24kg

**Step 3: Solve for the unknowns.**

We now have a system of three equations with three unknowns. We can solve this using substitution or elimination.  Let's use elimination:

1. **Solve for 'r':** Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2: (d + r) - (c + r) = 20kg - 10kg  This simplifies to d - c = 10kg

2. **Solve for 'c' and 'd':**  Now we have two equations:
   * d - c = 10kg
   * c + d = 24kg

   Add these two equations together:  (d - c) + (c + d) = 10kg + 24kg. This simplifies to 2d = 34kg, therefore d = 17kg (the dog weighs 17kg).

   Substitute the value of 'd' (17kg) back into either equation. Let's use Equation 3: c + 17kg = 24kg. Therefore c = 7kg (the cat weighs 7kg).


3. **Solve for 'r':** Substitute the value of 'c' (7kg) into Equation 1: 7kg + r = 10kg. Therefore r = 3kg (the rabbit weighs 3kg).

**Step 4: Find the weight in the final image.**

The final image shows the cat and the dog together with a rabbit on the dog's back.  We know:

* Cat = 7kg
* Dog = 17kg
* Rabbit = 3kg

Total weight = 7kg + 17kg + 3kg = 27kg

* Let the top left yellow square be 'A'.
* Let the top right yellow square be 'B'.
* Let the bottom left yellow square be 'C'.
* Let the bottom right yellow square be 'D'.

**2. Set up Equations:**

Based on the image, we can create the following equations:

* Equation 1: A + B = 8
* Equation 2: C - D = 6
* Equation 3: A + C = 13
* Equation 4: B + D = 8

**3. Solve the System of Equations:**

We have four equations and four unknowns.  Let's solve them systematically.

* **From Equation 4:**  We can express D in terms of B:  D = 8 - B

* **Substitute into Equation 2:** C - (8 - B) = 6  =>  C + B = 14

* **Now we have two equations with A and C:**
    * A + C = 13
    * C + B = 14

* **And two equations with A and B:**
    * A + B = 8
    * C + B = 14

* **Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3:** (A + C) - (A + B) = 13 - 8  =>  C - B = 5

* **Now we have two equations with B and C:**
    * C + B = 14
    * C - B = 5

* **Add these two equations:** (C + B) + (C - B) = 14 + 5  =>  2C = 19  =>  C = 9.5

* **Substitute C back into C - B = 5:** 9.5 - B = 5  =>  B = 4.5

* **Substitute B back into A + B = 8:** A + 4.5 = 8  =>  A = 3.5

* **Substitute B back into D = 8 - B:** D = 8 - 4.5  => D = 3.5


**4. Solution:**

Therefore, the solution is:

* A = 3.5
* B = 4.5
* C = 9.5
* D = 3.5

1. **Parentheses/Brackets:** First, solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 4 = 6

2. **Multiplication and Division (from left to right):**  The expression now becomes: 9 ÷ 3 * 6

   * We perform the division first: 9 ÷ 3 = 3

   * Then we perform the multiplication: 3 * 6 = 18

   *Therefore some sources would say the answer is 18.  But many people make a common error in assuming that implied multiplication (juxtaposition) has a higher priority than explicit multiplication.   If we were to treat implicit multiplication as having higher precedence than explicit multiplication or division, we get a different answer.

3. **Implicit Multiplication:**  Some interpretations of order of operations treat implicit multiplication (where there is no explicit multiplication symbol) as having higher precedence than explicit multiplication and division. In this interpretation the expression is:

   * 9 ÷ (3 * (2 + 4)) 
   * 9 ÷ (3 * 6)

**However, the correct answer using standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) is 18, which is not one of the answer choices.**  It appears the puzzle has a mistake or is designed to exploit the lack of clarity in how implicit multiplication might be interpreted.


**In conclusion:**  There's a flaw in the question. Following standard mathematical rules, the answer should be 18, but that's not an option. The problem likely intends for solvers to make an error or to treat implicit multiplication differently to arrive at 1, but it does not follow the standard order of operations consistently."|

   (x + y) + (x - y) = 8 + 6
   This simplifies to 2x = 14
   Therefore, x = 7

* Now substitute the value of x (which is 7) back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for y. Let's use Equation 1:
   7 + y = 8
   y = 1

**4. Solution:**

* The value of the top left yellow square (x) is 7.
* The value of the top right yellow square (y) is 1.

The bottom numbers (13 and 8) are simply a distraction and not needed for solving the puzzle.  They're the result of adding the columns in the puzzle."|

**1. Find the value of the Tic Tac box:**

* The first equation shows three Tic Tac boxes adding up to 60:  3 * Tic Tac = 60
* Therefore, one Tic Tac box is worth 20 (60 / 3 = 20).

**2. Find the value of the single bird:**

* The second equation shows one Tic Tac box (20) plus two birds equaling 30: 20 + 2 * Bird = 30
* Subtracting 20 from both sides: 2 * Bird = 10
* Therefore, one bird is worth 5 (10 / 2 = 5).

**3. Find the value of one shoe:**

* The third equation shows one bird (5) plus two shoes equaling 9: 5 + 2 * Shoe = 9
* Subtracting 5 from both sides: 2 * Shoe = 4
* Therefore, one shoe is worth 2 (4 / 2 = 2).

**4. Find the value of the boxing glove:**

* The fourth equation shows one Tic Tac box (20) plus one boxing glove plus one shoe (2) equaling 42: 20 + Glove + 2 = 42
* Subtracting 22 from both sides: Glove = 20

**5. Solve the final equation:**

* The final equation is: Tic Tac + Glasses Bird x Shoe = ?
* Substitute the values we found: 20 + (5 + 20) x 2 = ?
* Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we calculate the parenthesis first: 20 + 25 x 2 = ?
* Then, we do the multiplication: 20 + 50 = ?
* Finally, we add: 70

**1. Assign Variables:**

Let's use variables to represent the unknowns:

* Let 'J' represent the value of the jersey (number 10 jersey).
* Let 'B' represent the value of the football boots.
* Let 'H' represent the value of the helmet.
* Let 'F' represent the value of the football field.

**2. Formulate Equations:**

Based on the given equations in the image, we can create the following algebraic equations:

* Equation 1:  J - B = H + H  (or J - B = 2H)
* Equation 2:  9 = H + B
* Equation 3:  1 = B - H
* Equation 4:  F - H = J

**3. Solve for Variables:**

Now, let's solve this system of equations:

* **From Equation 3:** We can easily rearrange to find H = B - 1

* **Substitute into Equation 2:** Substitute the value of 'H' from equation 3 into equation 2:

   9 = (B - 1) + B
   9 = 2B - 1
   10 = 2B
   B = 5

* **Find H:** Substitute B = 5 back into the equation H = B - 1:

   H = 5 - 1
   H = 4

* **Find J:** Substitute B = 5 and H = 4 into Equation 1 (J - B = 2H) :

   J - 5 = 2 * 4
   J - 5 = 8
   J = 13

* **Find F:** Substitute the values of J and H into Equation 4 (F - H = J)

   F - 4 = 13
   F = 17

**4. Final Calculation:**

The final equation to solve is:  J + B + H + F = ?

Substitute the values we found:

13 + 5 + 4 + 17 = 39

**Therefore, the answer to the puzzle is 39.**"|

**1. Find the Value of the Feather:**

* Look at the first equation: Shoe × Sweater × Feather = 0
* Any number multiplied by zero equals zero.  Therefore, the feather must have a value of 0.

**2. Find the Value of the Sunglasses and Mustache:**

* Now look at the equation: Sunglasses & Mustache × Feather = 12
* Since the feather is 0,  this equation becomes: Sunglasses & Mustache × 0 = 12, which is not possible.  There is an error in the image.  The correct equation should likely be Shoe x Sunglasses & Mustache = 15

**3. Find the Value of the Shoe:**

* Using the corrected equation Shoe x Sunglasses & Mustache = 15  and the second equation Shoe x Sunglasses & Mustache = 15,  we can focus on solving for the shoe.  We'll revisit the Sunglasses & Mustache later.


**4. Find the Value of the Sunglasses and Mustache (revisited):**

* Look at the third equation: Sunglasses & Mustache × Feather = 12.  This is problematic because the feather is 0.  This equation is inconsistent with the rest of the puzzle. We have to assume this is a typing error, and focus on the corrected equations.

**5. Solve for the Shoe:**

* Look at the fourth equation: Shoe × Feather = 20
* We know the Feather = 0 which implies the Shoe cannot be a value that, when multiplied by 0, will equal 20.  This equation is also problematic and inconsistent.


**Conclusion:**

There's a significant error in the provided equations making the puzzle unsolvable as written.  The equations are self-contradictory. To solve this, you'd need corrected or clarified equations from the original source."|

**1. Find the weight of the frog:**

* **Image 1:**  Frog + Sheep = 10kg
* **Image 2:** Frog + Horse = 20kg

Subtract the first equation from the second:

(Frog + Horse) - (Frog + Sheep) = 20kg - 10kg

This simplifies to:

Horse - Sheep = 10kg

**2. Find the weight of the sheep:**

* **Image 3:** Horse + Sheep = 24kg

We know from step 1 that Horse = Sheep + 10kg.  Substitute this into the equation above:

(Sheep + 10kg) + Sheep = 24kg

Combine like terms:

2 * Sheep = 14kg

Sheep = 7kg

**3. Find the weight of the horse:**

We know Horse = Sheep + 10kg, and Sheep = 7kg, so:

Horse = 7kg + 10kg = 17kg

**4. Find the weight of the final scenario:**

* **Image 4:** Frog + Sheep + Horse = ?

We know:

* Frog + Sheep = 10kg (from Image 1)
* Horse = 17kg

Therefore:

Frog + Sheep + Horse = 10kg + 17kg = 27kg

**Answer:** The missing weight in the final image is $\boxed{27kg}$"|
