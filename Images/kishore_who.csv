1. **Observation:** The puzzle asks to identify the alien.  We need to look for something unusual or inconsistent within the context of a normal grocery store scene.

2. **Analyzing the Options:**
    * **A:** The man is significantly hunched over, almost abnormally so, while interacting with the produce.  This posture is unusual compared to the other characters.
    * **B:** The woman is standing normally and seemingly engages in typical grocery store behaviour.
    * **C:** The pregnant woman and child are also presented in a common, realistic way.

3. **Conclusion:** The man's unnatural posture stands out as the oddity in the scene. It's not something typically associated with humans shopping. Therefore, option A is the most likely candidate for the alien. The puzzle plays on the assumption that an alien might not fully grasp human social norms and body language."|
Picture-puzzle-iq-test-find-the-alien_jpg.jpg|"The alien is the woman in the purple dress. Here's why:

1. **Floral Hair Ornament:** The woman in the purple dress has a flower in her hair that seems out of place compared to the other two women's more traditional hairstyles.  The style of flower and how it's placed is unnatural, suggesting a design choice different from the style of the crowns and the apparent lack of ornamentation on the other's hair.

2. **Subtle Differences:** While not as prominent as the flower, the subtle differences in the dress design and the way her hands are positioned compared to the others subtly adds to the idea she is out of place.

Therefore, the puzzle relies on a visual detail to identify the alien character among the princesses; a subtle difference to make the observer assess their surroundings with a more curious mind."|

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Observation:** The puzzle relies on finding something unusual or out of place. We need to compare the three passengers to find discrepancies.

2. **The clue:** The image shows the reflection of the passengers in the airplane windows. The woman in red and the man reading a newspaper have normal reflections.  The reflection of the woman in yellow shows a different, distorted image compared to her real appearance.

3. **The solution:** This distortion in her reflection hints that she isn't human, making her the ""alien"" in the puzzle.  It's a visual anomaly used to indicate her otherworldly nature."|
cebdfdd98fc893cf45a585c04fd03d13.jpg|"Here's how we can solve this puzzle step-by-step:

**1. Analyze the Scene:**

The image depicts a restaurant with a dead woman lying near the restroom.  There are four suspects numbered 1 through 4.  We need to find clues suggesting motive and opportunity.

**2. Eliminate Suspects Based on Opportunity:**

* **Suspect 1:** This person is too far away from the victim, and there's no direct line of sight or easy path to the restroom.  Highly unlikely.

* **Suspect 2:** This person is also some distance away, and unlikely to have had the opportunity to commit the murder unnoticed.

* **Suspect 3:** This suspect is close enough to the victim, but their proximity is not sufficient evidence for guilt. This needs further assessment.

* **Suspect 4:** This person is quite close to the victim's location.  They are a possibility.

**3. Look for Clues Suggesting Motive:**

The image doesn't directly provide motives.  However, there's an important detail:

* **The Chef:** This is the critical observation.  The chef is actively serving customers but is not wearing gloves.  While not explicitly a motive, we can assume there is an expectation of food hygiene in a restaurant.  This suggests the most likely motive to be a disgruntled restaurant employee attempting to poison someone.

**4. Connect the Dots:**

The only way for the chef to have potentially poisoned the victim without direct contact while maintaining plausible deniability would be by poisoning the food that the victim just ate.  Therefore, suspect 4, the only one shown eating, is the most likely candidate. The poisoning method would allow the chef time to maintain their position. This eliminates the need for direct contact and accounts for the distance between the chef and the victim.

**5. Conclusion:**

The most likely killer is **Suspect 4**. While we don't have absolute certainty, this deduction is the most logical interpretation given the visual information provided."|

1. **Observation:** The puzzle asks to identify the ""alien,"" implying someone who doesn't fit in with the others.  We need to look for inconsistencies or unusual features compared to the other individuals.

2. **Analyzing the Group:** Let's compare the characters:

    * **Character A (Man):**  He is slouching and has a generally different posture from the others.  

    * **Character B (Woman):**  Her hair color is unusual but not inherently out of place in a grocery store.

    * **Character C (Woman):** She is pregnant, which, while not a daily occurrence, is still something that could happen in a normal setting.

    * **Character D (Child):** He's a child—a normal sight in grocery stores.

3. **Identifying the Difference:**  The most noticeable difference is Character A's unnatural posture. The other characters are standing more naturally and upright. His posture is stiff and unnatural, suggesting a lack of understanding of standard human behavior.

4. **Conclusion:** While the other characters have unique traits, Character A's posture is the most significant anomaly.  Therefore, the ""alien"" is most likely A, someone who is acting differently from the expected human behavior in a grocery store environment."|
picture-puzzle-with-answers_jpg_1.jpg|"The answer to the brain teaser is that the **woman in the purple shirt** is the zombie.

Here's the reasoning:


1. **The clues are subtle:** This isn't about obvious zombie traits like rotting flesh.  The puzzle relies on observing unusual details.

2. **The woman's unusual behavior:** Notice that the woman in the purple shirt is drooling. Drooling isn't a typical behavior for a person standing in a bank line and is unusual enough to warrant attention.

3. **Eliminating the others:** The man in the green shirt has some visible wear and tear, but it looks more like he is simply dressed down or maybe slightly raggedy; he doesn't display any other zombie-like features.  The woman in the blue outfit is perfectly normal in her demeanor.

4. **The subtle nature of the puzzle:**  The purpose of the puzzle is to make you think outside the box and not to look for classic horror-movie zombie characteristics.

Therefore, the drooling woman is the most logical candidate for being the zombie."|
picture-puzzles-with-answers_jpg_26.jpg|"The alien is Granny B. Here's why:

1. **Anatomical Differences:**  Granny B's face and body proportions are subtly different from the others. Her eyes are positioned slightly further apart, and her nose and mouth are less conventionally shaped.  The overall shape of her face and head is slightly elongated and asymmetrical compared to the others.

2. **Lack of Realistic Details:** While Grannies A and C have details like wrinkles and realistic-looking glasses, Granny B's glasses look more like a mask or poorly fitting eyewear. Her facial features appear less detailed and almost cartoonishly exaggerated compared to the others, further hinting at something being ""off.""

3. **Subtle Hints:** The puzzle uses the word ""granny,"" hinting that the answer likely lies in subtle differences in appearances rather than drastic ones.  It would be obvious if one granny were distinctly monstrous. The puzzle is designed to be deceptively simple.


The puzzle plays on our tendency to look for dramatic differences instead of subtle anomalies.  Granny B's slightly off features are suggestive of something non-human, making her the most likely alien."|
