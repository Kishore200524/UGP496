**Circle 1:**

* (64 * 5) / 7 = 320 / 7 = 45.7 (approximately). This doesn't match the 40 provided, so there is another aspect to the pattern.

**Circle 2:**

* (81 * 7) / 7 = 81.  This doesn't match the 63 provided.

**Let's try a different approach.**  Let's look at the difference between the numbers:

**Circle 1:**

* 64 - 5 = 59
* 64 - 40 = 24
* 40 - 5 = 35

**Circle 2:**

* 81 - 7 = 74
* 81 - 63 = 18
* 63 - 7 = 56

**Circle 3:**

* 16 - 4 = 12


There's no clear pattern emerging from the differences.  Let's examine the numbers themselves:

Notice that all the numbers are multiples of 7 or near multiples of 7.  Let's check to see if multiplying the two top numbers and *then* dividing by 7, the result can be adjusted to yield the bottom number:

**Circle 1:**

* 64 x 5 = 320
* 320 / 7 ≈ 45.7  Not close to 40

**Circle 2:**

* 81 x 7 = 567
* 567 / 7 = 81  Not close to 63

The puzzle is flawed or needs additional information.  There is no consistent mathematical relationship between the three numbers in each circle that can be used to solve for the missing number.

Therefore, there's no reliable way to determine the missing number using only the information given."|

* **Example 1:** 3 x 1 = 10. This is incorrect; there must be another step involved.

Let's try a different approach.  Let's look at the sums of the top numbers and see if that helps:

* **Example 1:** 3 + 1 = 4.  Then 4 * 2.5 = 10. Where does 2.5 come from?

* **Example 2:** 4 + 3 = 7. Then 7 * 3.57... ≈ 25.  Again, we're missing a connection.

Let's try multiplication then addition:

* **Example 1:** 3 * 1 + 7 = 10
* **Example 2:** 4 * 3 + 13 = 25
* **Example 3:** 1 * 4 + 13 = 17

Notice a pattern forming?  It appears that the solution is to multiply the two upper numbers and then add 7 to get the bottom number.

Therefore, for the last example:

2 * 5 + 7 = 10 + 7 = 17

**Therefore the missing number is 17.**"|

3. **i:** 'i' is the 3rd vowel. 3 * 6 = 18

4. **o:** 'o' is the 4th vowel. 4 * 7.5 = 30

a5a2ba284cf194ceea4032d5494fe223.jpg|"This math puzzle uses a hidden pattern. Let's break it down step by step:

**1. Analyze the given equations:**

Notice that the answers aren't simple sums. Let's examine the relationship between the numbers on the left and right sides of each equation:


* **5 + 3 = 28:**  (5 * 3) = 15, (5 * 3 + 3) = 18, (5 * 3 + 13) = 28.
* **9 + 1 = 810:** (9 * 1) = 9, (9 * 1 + 0) = 9, (9*1 + 801) = 810
* **8 + 6 = 214:** (8 * 6) = 48, (8*6 + 0) = 48, (8*6 + 166) = 214


**2. Identify the Pattern:**

There seems to be a pattern involving multiplication and addition:

* **First number * Second number = A**
* **First number * Second number + (First number * 10 + Second number) = Result**


Let's test this theory:


* **5 + 3:** (5 * 3) = 15; (5 * 10) + 3 = 53; 15 + 53 = 68


**3. Refining the pattern:**

The proposed pattern doesn't work for the first example. Let's go back to the drawing board and try a different approach to the pattern.

Let's look at the numbers again:

* **5 + 3 = 28:** (5*3) = 15, (5-3) = 2, Combine to get 215, we can see that the first and third number are multiplied. 5 x 3 = 15, and then add the numbers to get the answer 15 + 13 = 28. 
* **9 + 1 = 810:** (9*1) = 9, (9-1) = 8, Combine to get 809, plus 1 = 810.
* **8 + 6 = 214:** (8*6) = 48, (8-6) = 2, Combine to get 248. 248 + 166 = 214.
* **5 + 4 = 19:** (5*4) = 20, (5-4) = 1, Combine to get 120, the number 19 is incorrect using this pattern.



**4.  A New Pattern:**

* **First number * Second number = A**
* **(First Number - Second Number) + (First number * 10 + Second number)  = Answer**

This seems to be a closer fit to all the results:

* **5 + 3 = 28:** (5 * 3) = 15, (5 - 3) = 2,  215 does not equal 28.

Let's try this pattern:

* **First number * Second number = A**
* **(First number * Second number) + (First number * 10 + (Second number * 10))**
* **5 + 3:** (5 * 3) = 15; (5 * 10) + (3 * 10) = 80; 15 + 80 = 95

Still not working correctly. After multiple attempts and consideration of different patterns, there is no consistent mathematical rule that seems to work for this puzzle.


**5. Conclusion**

There may be a mistake in the puzzle itself, or a more complex pattern is present that hasn't been deciphered yet. Based on all the attempts, there is no apparent logical formula to solve this. It could even be a flawed puzzle."|
a7b8274dcf1d08fed51bc3441bc7aadb.jpg|"Here's how to solve this math puzzle:

**1. Identify the Pattern:**

The pattern isn't immediately obvious; it's not simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.  Let's examine each equation individually.

* **123 = 12:**  1 + 2 + 3 = 6.  Then, 6 * 2 = 12.
* **134 = 20:** 1 + 3 + 4 = 8. Then, 8 * 2.5 = 20.
* **253 = 40:** 2 + 5 + 3 = 10. Then, 10 * 4 = 40.
* **261 = 21:** 2 + 6 + 1 = 9. Then, 9 * 2.333... is approximately 21.

**2. Refine the Pattern:**

Notice that the multiplier seems to be increasing but not linearly.  This indicates that the multiplier is influenced somehow by the original numbers. Let's consider using the last number, the last digit. This yields the following:

* **123 = 12:** 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.  Then, 6 * 2 (double of last digit 3) = 12.
* **134 = 20:** 1 + 3 + 4 = 8. Then, 8 * 2.5 (2.5 because the last digit is 4 which is doubled = 8)  = 20.
* **253 = 40:** 2 + 5 + 3 = 10. Then, 10 * 4 (double of the last digit 3) = 40.
* **261 = 21:** 2 + 6 + 1 = 9. Then, 9 * 2.333... ≈ 21 (The last digit is 1. If we double it is 2.  A reasonable multiplier can be approximated as 2.333..)


**3. Test the Refined Pattern:**

This pattern does not always work in a consistent way. Let's try a different approach. Let's only consider the first two digits and the last digit as follows:


* **123 = 12:** (1 + 2) * 3 = 9. There is no consistent pattern here yet.
* **134 = 20:** (1 + 3) * 4 = 16
* **253 = 40:** (2 + 5) * 3 = 21.


Let's test another approach. Let's try subtracting the last digit from the sum of the first two digits then multiply the result by the last digit.

* **123 = 12:** (1 + 2) - 3 = 0. 0 * 3 = 0. This does not work.
* **134 = 20:** (1 + 3) - 4 = 0. 0 * 4 = 0. This does not work.
* **253 = 40:** (2 + 5) - 3 = 4. 4 * 3 = 12. This does not work.
* **261 = 21:** (2 + 6) - 1 = 7. 7 * 1 = 7. This does not work.


Let's test another approach. This time, let's sum all three digits and multiply the sum by the last digit.
* **123 = 12:** (1 + 2 + 3) * 3 = 18. This does not work.
* **134 = 20:** (1 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 32. This does not work.
* **253 = 40:** (2 + 5 + 3) * 3 = 30. This does not work.
* **261 = 21:** (2 + 6 + 1) * 1 = 9. This does not work.



Let's try another approach:

* **123 = 12:** (1*2) + 3 = 5, 5*2=10 (this does not work)
* **134 = 20:** (1*3) + 4 = 7, 7*2 = 14 (this does not work)
* **253 = 40:** (2*5) + 3 = 13, 13*3 = 39 (this does not work)

There seems to be an inconsistency in this pattern.  Therefore, I cannot find a definitive rule that perfectly explains all the given equations.  The puzzle may be flawed or requires additional information or another pattern.  There are no apparent consistent mathematical rules to solve this puzzle."|
b455314161b3b078d168ae6aba448537.jpg|"Here's how to solve this matchstick puzzle:

**1. Understand the Problem:**

The current equation, represented by matchsticks, is 1 + 2 = 8.  This is incorrect. The goal is to make it a true equation by moving only one matchstick.

**2. Analyze the Possibilities:**

To make a true equation, we need to change one of the digits (1, 2, or 8) or the plus or equals sign.  Let's look at the possibilities:

* **Changing the '1':**  Moving a matchstick from the '1' can only create a '4' or '7'.  Neither of these creates a correct equation.
* **Changing the '2':** Moving a matchstick from the '2' could make it a '1' or '3'. Making it '3' works to give a true equation!
* **Changing the '8':** It's possible to change this to a '0' or a '5'. But nothing makes a true equation.
* **Changing the '+' or '=':** Moving a match from the '+' creates other symbols, but none create a correct equation.  Moving a match from the '=' would yield nothing useful.


**3. The Solution:**

Take the top horizontal matchstick from the '2' and place it diagonally across the '=' sign to make it the number '5'.  This transforms the equation into:

1 + 1 = 2

This is a true equation.  We only moved one matchstick.

Therefore, the solution involves moving the top horizontal matchstick from the '2' to make '5'."|

c7b8e2df5b1905ccae3ec0800a837c5c.jpg|"Here's how to solve this brain teaser step-by-step:

**1. Deconstructing the First Clause:**

* ""When the day after tomorrow is yesterday...""  This statement means that if we were to shift forward two days, that second day would be considered the same day as the day before today.  This implies we're dealing with a highly unusual time shift, which is a key to solving the puzzle.

**2.  Deconstructing the Second Clause:**

* ""...then today will be as far from Wednesday as today was from Wednesday when the day before yesterday was tomorrow."" This is the core of the puzzle. It sets up a symmetry or equivalence. Let's break down each half separately:
    * **First Half:** ""Today will be as far from Wednesday...""  This refers to a future distance from Wednesday.
    * **Second Half:** ""...as today was from Wednesday when the day before yesterday was tomorrow."" This refers to a past distance from Wednesday.  The statement ""the day before yesterday was tomorrow"" means the day before yesterday is the future day after today. This is essentially the same scenario as the first clause, which requires a large time shift. 


**3. Finding the Symmetry:**

The puzzle hinges on the symmetry between a past distance from Wednesday and a future distance from Wednesday. This symmetry can only exist if the puzzle has a time wrap around, where the time moves circularly. The only way these two distances can be equal is if “today” is equidistant from Wednesday in both directions.

**4. The Solution:**

Because of the time wrap-around, the only day that works is **Sunday**.  Here is why:

* **Sunday:** If today is Sunday, then:
    * The day after tomorrow (Tuesday) being the same as yesterday (Saturday) requires a time-shift.
    * Sunday is two days away from Wednesday (both before and after Wednesday, wrapping around the week).


**In summary:** The puzzle plays on our typical understanding of linear time.  The statement that ""the day after tomorrow is yesterday"" forces us to consider a ""wrapping"" of time.  That is where the logic of the second clause plays out. The only day that can be equidistant from Wednesday in both past and future, given that particular time wrap around, is Sunday."|

The pattern is that the result is obtained by subtracting the first digit from the last digit, and then adding that result to the sum of the first two digits.

Let's break it down example by example:

* **592 = 47:**  (9 + 5) + (2 - 5) = 14 + (-3) = 11.  This isn't working. Let's try a different approach.

Let's try subtracting the last digit from the first digit, and then adding the result to the sum of the first and last digits.

* **592 = 47:** (5-2) + (5+2) = 3 + 7 = 10. Nope.

Let's consider differences between digits:

* **592 = 47:** (9-5) + (2-5) = 4 + (-3) = 1. Nope.

Let's try something else:  The difference between the hundreds digit and the tens digit, then the sum of the tens digit and the units digit.  This looks promising!

* **592 = 47:** (5-9) = -4.  (9+2) = 11. So we have -4, 11. How do we combine?  It appears that a possible interpretation of the subtraction is to take the absolute value; this gives |5-9| = 4. Thus, we have (4, 11). We have a problem; how do we combine?

Let's look at the other examples.  Let's try subtracting the hundreds digit from the tens digit, and then adding the result to the sum of the hundreds digit and the ones digit.

* **592 = 47:** (9-5) + (5+2) = 4 + 7 = 11. This doesn't seem right. Let's look at the others.

Let's try a different approach. It seems like the pattern involves a combination of the digits.  Let's consider subtracting the second digit from the first and adding the third digit to the result:


* **592 = 47:** (5 - 9) + 2 = -2. (Doesn't work).

**Let's try a different pattern:**  Subtracting the last digit from the first digit and then adding the tens digit.

* **592 = 47:** (5 - 2) + 9 = 12. (Doesn't work).

After exploring several patterns, the correct solution is:  **The difference between the first two digits, plus the last digit.**

Let's test this:

* **592 = 47:** (9-5) + 2 = 6  (Not quite correct). Let's try another interpretation: The first digit minus the second digit, plus the third. This gives (5-9) + 2 = -2, which is still incorrect.

Let's try addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  Looking at the first triangle:

* **Addition:** 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 (doesn't equal 2).
* **Subtraction:** various subtractions of 1, 3, and 5 don't consistently yield 2.
* **Multiplication:** 1 * 3 * 5 = 15 (doesn't equal 2).
* **Division:** Various divisions also yield no obvious consistent pattern.

* **1 + 3 - 5 = -1**
* **5 + 3 - 1 = 7**

Let's test a different approach. Let's focus on the relationship between the numbers.  Maybe it's not a simple arithmetic relationship.


**3. Try a Different Approach: Multiplication and Addition/Subtraction**


Let's look at the second triangle (2, 26, 11):

* Notice that 26 = 2 * 11 + 4.
Let's try applying a similar pattern to the first triangle (1, 5, 3, 2):
* 1*3 + 2 = 5
* 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 (Doesn't work)

Let's test the third triangle (3, 18, 2, 4):

* 3*2 + 12 = 18.


**4. Discover the Pattern**

It appears that the top number is the product of the bottom two numbers, plus an additional constant (which could be determined via some basic algebra but is not needed in this case).

* **Triangle 1:** 1 * 3 + 1 * 2 = 5.   1 * 3 + (x) = 5  => x = 2. This doesn't fit.
* **Triangle 2:** 2 * 11 + 4 = 26 (Does not work)

Let's try a different approach:

**5. Find the True Pattern: Multiplication + Difference**

Looking at the triangles again, a more consistent pattern emerges. The top number is the product of the bottom two numbers, plus or minus their difference:

* **Triangle 1 (1, 5, 3, 2):** (1 * 3) + (3 - 1) = 5
* **Triangle 2 (2, 26, 11, 2):** (2 * 11) + (11 - 2) = 26 + 9 = 35.  This pattern doesn't work here either.
* **Triangle 3 (3, 18, 2, 4):** (3 * 2) + (4 - 3) = 7. This doesn't work either.

* **Triangle 2:** (2 * 11) + (11 - 2) = 26 + 9 = 35 (incorrect)
* **Triangle 3:** (3 * 2) + (4 - 2) = 8 (incorrect)

d3715dbd0cb5c512c114b4a61d4daeb2.jpg|"Here's how to solve this math puzzle:

**1. Identify the Pattern:**

The puzzle relies on counting the number of smaller squares within the larger square.

* The first square is divided into four smaller squares.  

* The second square is divided into nine smaller squares.


**2.  Establish the Relationship:**

The given equation shows that a square with four smaller squares equals 5.  This doesn't mean each small square equals 5/4; instead, it's showing us a pattern in the relationship between the number of smaller squares and the equation's answer.

**3.  Solve for the Unknown:**

The second square has nine smaller squares. If we use the relationship of the first square and assume the pattern is based on adding one to the square root of the number of smaller squares (√4 +1 = 3), and that is equal to 5, then:

(√9 + 1) = 4


Therefore, the equation is based on the value of (√x + 1) where x is the number of smaller squares in the figure. Therefore, if the figure has 9 smaller squares, it would equal 4.

**Answer:** The solution to the second equation is 4."|
d86613351cc99c79824b8a41abbdd989.jpg|"The solution to this math puzzle is **4**. Here's how we arrive at the answer step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Pattern:**  Observe the relationship between the numbers in each row.  The puzzle isn't about adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing directly across the rows.

2. **Square Roots:** Notice that some numbers are perfect squares (9, 16, 25, 49, 64, 81, 36, and 1).  This is often a clue in these types of puzzles.

3. **Relationship Discovery:**  Let's look at the relationship between the perfect squares and the other numbers.  Take the first row:

   * 9 (3²) + 7 = 16 (4²)

   * 25 (5²) + 12 = 49 (7²)

   * 81 (9²) + 17 = 64 (8²) 


4. **Applying the Pattern:** Using this pattern, let's solve for the bottom row:

   * 1 (1²) + ? = 36 (6²)

   * To find the missing number, subtract the square of one from the square of six: 36 - 1 = 35

5. **Final Answer:** There's still a problem because we have only perfect squares and their sums. We need to re-examine the pattern. If we were to follow the sequence above then the missing number would be 35. But that would mean that the equation 1 + 35 = 36 is incorrect.


Let's try another perspective:


* Consider only the numbers that are perfect squares: 9, 16, 25, 49, 64, 81, 36, 1. If we look at these in rows the pattern is 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 6, 1.


If we take each number as the square root of the perfect square the pattern can be shown:
* Row 1: 3, 7, 4
* Row 2: 5, 12, 7
* Row 3: 9, 17, 8
* Row 4: 1, x, 6

This does not help to determine the missing number.

Let's try another pattern. Let's look at the differences between the numbers:


* Row 1: 9 - 7 = 2, 7 + 9 = 16
* Row 2: 25 - 12 = 13, 12 + 37 = 49
* Row 3: 81 - 17 = 64, 17 + 47 = 64
* Row 4: 1 - x = ?, x + ? = 36

This does not help either.

After checking other possible patterns, there appears to be a mistake in the puzzle image.  There isn't a consistent mathematical relationship across the rows that would allow us to solve this.


**Therefore, there's likely an error in the puzzle itself.**"|
d98513a8b29eb262206545f29b5a0d58.jpg|"The pattern is:  (First number * Second Number) + (First number * 10) = Result

Let's break down the examples:

* **1 + 5 = 75:** (1 * 5) + (1 * 10) = 5 + 10 = 15.  This doesn't match the provided answer, but let's check for a variation.  It could be (1 * 5) * 10 + 5 = 55, still wrong. Let's try (1 + 5) * 10 + 5 = 65, wrong again.  It seems like the puzzle has a mistake in the answer. However, Let's use the provided answers and find the solution to the pattern.  Using the provided answer, we can conclude that the solution is to multiply the two numbers and then append the first number to the result.

* **1 + 4 = 56:** (1 * 4) = 4,  append 1 to 4 = 41.  This doesn't match, let's try another variation.  (1*4)*10 + (1*1) = 41, incorrect. Let's try what the provided solution is, which is (1 * 4) and then append the first number which is 1 to make it 41. Incorrect.  (1+4)*10 + 4 = 54, close.

Let's try a different approach based on the provided answers:

* **1 + 5 = 75:** (1*10+5)*10 - 5 = 145, that's wrong.

Let's analyze the provided answers:

* **1 + 5 = 75:** The result is 75
* **1 + 4 = 56:** The result is 56
* **1 + 3 = 39:** The result is 39

Notice a pattern:  In each case, the result seems to be calculated as `(second number) * 10 + (second number -1)`

Let's test this:

* 1 + 5 = (5*10) + (5-1) = 54 (close but not matching the given solution.


Let's try a new approach, since the previous one is not matching the provided answers.   It appears that the puzzle is designed to use the provided answers as a pattern.  Let's use the provided answers as guidance:

* 1 + 5 = 75
* 1 + 4 = 56
* 1 + 3 = 39

If we assume the pattern is to take the second number, multiply it by 10, and then subtract 4 from the result, we get the following:

* 1 + 5 = (5 * 10) - 5 = 45 (not matching the given)
* 1 + 4 = (4 * 10) - 4 = 36 (not matching the given)
* 1 + 3 = (3 * 10) - 3 = 27 (not matching the given)


Let's try yet another approach, multiplying the two numbers and then appending the first number to the result.

* 1 + 5 = (1 * 5) = 5, appending 1 makes it 51
* 1 + 4 = (1 * 4) = 4, appending 1 makes it 41
* 1 + 3 = (1 * 3) = 3, appending 1 makes it 31

This doesn't match either.

* **12 + 13 = 52:** The result 52 seems to follow a pattern of the same style as above.  The standard addition would be 25 and the answer shows 52.

**1. Find the Value of a Single Line Segment:**

* The first equation shows a grid of nine small squares, which is made up of 12 line segments.  If that equals 9, then each line segment represents 9 / 12 = 0.75.

**2. Find the Value of a Single Intersection Point:**

* The second equation shows a plus sign, made up of 4 line segments and 1 intersection point.   We know that 4 line segments equal 4 * 0.75 = 3.  Since the plus sign equals 1, that implies the single intersection point has a value of 1 - 3 = -2.

**3. Solve the Final Equation:**

* The third equation is similar to the first,  however, it has one less intersection.  This means the solution is 9 - (-2) = 11.   The shape is made of 12 line segments and 4 intersection points.   12 * 0.75 + 4 * (-2) = 9 + (-8) = 1.

**1. Identify the Pattern:**

Observe the relationship between the numbers in each triangle.  The pattern is that the top number is the sum of the two bottom numbers multiplied by the number on the far left.

* Top number: 2
* Bottom left: 1
* Bottom right: 3

The calculation is (1 + 3) * 1 = 4. This doesn't match the top number, so let's try a different approach.  Let's try multiplying the bottom two numbers and adding the top.

The calculation is (1 * 3) + 2 = 5. This also doesn't match the top number.

Let's try a different pattern.

Let's try a different pattern.  Let's try multiplying the bottom two numbers and adding the result to the top number:

(1 x 3) + 2 = 5 (This doesn't work)


Let's try another variation: Multiply the two bottom numbers and then *add* the top number:

(1 * 3) + 2 = 5

This doesn't seem to work either. Let's try another pattern.


Let's try multiplying the bottom numbers then multiplying the result by the top number:

(1 * 3) * 2 = 6.  This doesn't seem to work.


Let's try a different approach. Let's try this pattern: The number at the top is the product of the bottom two numbers.

Let's check the other triangles to see if this holds true.


Triangle 2: (2 x ?) + 4 = 26.  Solving for ? = 11.

Triangle 3: (3 x 2) + 4 = 10 (This doesn't work)


Let's try another pattern:  Top number = (bottom left + bottom right) * Top


Triangle 1: (1 + 3) * 2 = 8

Triangle 2: (2 + ?) * 4 = 26.

(2 + ?) = 26/4 = 6.5. This doesn't work.

Let's try a different pattern. Let's assume the top number is derived from the product of the two bottom numbers multiplied by some coefficient. Let's call it 'k'.


Then k * (bottom left * bottom right) + top number =  resulting number

Triangle 1: k(1*3) + 2 = 8  => 3k = 6 => k = 2

Let's test this on triangle 3: 2*(3*2) + 4 = 16 (This doesn't work either)



Let's go back to our first attempt but with a slight modification:


Let's try adding the two bottom numbers, then multiply by the top number.

Triangle 1: (1 + 3) * 2 = 8. This works!


Triangle 2: (2 + x) * 4 = 26.  Solving for x gives us x = 4.5


Triangle 3: (3 + 2) * 4 = 20 (This doesn't work)



Let's use a different approach. Let's try adding the bottom two numbers, then multiplying by a factor.


Let's examine triangle 1: 1 + 3 = 4.  Multiply by 2 gives 8.  The top number is 2.


Triangle 2: 2 + x = y.  4 * y = 26. So y = 6.5. 2 + x = 6.5.  x = 4.5.


Triangle 3: 3 + 2 = 5.  5*k = 27.   k = 5.4.

The key is that the plant *doubles* in size each day.  This isn't about the number of plants, but the total area covered by the plant(s).

**2. Work backward from the full pond:**

If the pond is full on day 30 with one plant, that means on day 29 it was half-full (since it doubles in size daily).

**3. Determine the initial size:**

**4. Consider starting with 4 plants:**

If the man starts with 4 plants,  on day 0, these plants initially cover 4*(1/2<sup>30</sup>) of the pond. This is equivalent to the size of the pond covered by one plant on day 2 of its growth (1/2<sup>28</sup>) since 4 = 2<sup>2</sup>.

* **523:** All digits are wrong.
* **286:** One digit is correct, but in the wrong place.

**2. Start with the most informative clue:**

The clue ""189 - One digit is correct and in its place"" is the most helpful.  This tells us one of the digits in the combination is either 1, 8, or 9.

**3. Use elimination and cross-referencing:**

* Let's assume the '1' in '189' is correct.  This means the '1' cannot be in the first position of the lock combination, according to the clue that says one digit of '147' is correct but in the wrong place. So the 1 is in the 2nd or 3rd position.

* Clue ""964 - Two digits are correct but both are in the wrong place"" tells us that neither 9 nor 6 nor 4 is in the right position.

* ""523 - All digits are wrong"" eliminates these three digits.

* The clues ""147"" and ""286"" both confirm that a 1, 8, 6, and 4 are candidates for the three-digit combination.  In these clues, there is a 1 and an 8, and a 6 and a 4 that might be possibilities.

**4. Deduce the solution:**

* Let’s try using the '8' from 189.  '8' is in the right place and therefore the correct combination should have '8' in the middle. 

* Considering the clues ""147"" and ""286"", a '4' is a possible candidate. If it was 4, it cannot be in the first or second place according to the clue ""964"" and the 8 already being in the second position.  Therefore, 4 must be in the last position.  This leaves the first position for the 1.

* Thus, the combination is **184**.

**5. Verify the solution:**

Let's check if our solution (184) satisfies all clues:

* **147:** Contains '1' and '4' from our answer, but not in the correct places.
* **189:** Contains '8' in the correct place.
* **964:** Contains '4' and '8'  but in the wrong places.
* **523:** All digits are wrong — this is consistent with our solution.
* **286:** Contains '8' but in the wrong place.

* Add the units digit of the first number (1) to the second number (3): 1 + 3 = 4
* Subtract the tens digit from the sum: 4 - 5 = -1.  Since there is a negative number, the absolute value is taken to arrive at 1.
* Then it is assumed that the equation should equal 8.  This suggests that there is an extra 7 that needs to be added.   The next step will see if this holds true.


**Step 2: Analyze the second equation**

73 + 2 = 23

* Take the tens digit of the first number (7).
* Add the units digit of the first number (3) and the second number (2): 3 + 2 = 5
* Subtract the tens digit from the sum: 5 - 7 = -2. Again, we take the absolute value of -2 which is 2.
* We must add 21 to arrive at the answer of 23.


**Step 3: Analyze the third equation**

82 + 5 = 15

* Take the tens digit of the first number (8).
* Add the units digit of the first number (2) and the second number (5): 2 + 5 = 7
* Subtract the tens digit from the sum: 7 - 8 = -1.  The absolute value is 1.
* Add 14 to arrive at the answer 15.


**Step 4: Solve the fourth equation**

94 + 8 = ?

* Take the tens digit of the first number (9).
* Add the units digit of the first number (4) and the second number (8): 4 + 8 = 12
* Subtract the tens digit from the sum: 12 - 9 = 3.
* Add to 3 to the 12 to get 15, however there is no constant rule regarding the addition required to the result, and it is assumed that there is a constant addition value of the number 7, which is consistent with the first three examples.

**1. Identify the Pattern:**

The puzzle involves a pyramid of numbers.  The pattern lies in the relationship between a number and the two numbers directly below it. Observe that the top number (2) is the *sum* of the two numbers directly below it (5 + 3 = 8 and 8 - 6 = 2). Let's see if this pattern applies to other rows.

**2. Test the Pattern:**

* **Row 2:** 5 + 3 = 8,  8 - 6 = 2 ( This works )
* **Row 3:** 6 + 1 + ? = 8+2+3+7 = 20 - 6 - 8 - 2 - 3 - 7 = 4  This looks promising.

**3. Solve for the Missing Number:**

Let's use the same pattern for the bottom row to determine the missing number:

* The sum of the bottom row is 8 + 2 + 3 + 7 = 20
* The top number of the row directly above is 5 + 3 = 8
* The top number of the row directly above is 6 + 1 + x = 7 + x where x is the missing number.

Let’s consider that the sum of the numbers in the bottom row is 20. The sum of the numbers in the second row from the bottom is 6 + 1 + ? = 7 + ? . If we subtract the sum of the second row from the bottom row, we have 20 - 7 - ? = 13 - ? .The sum of the numbers in the top row is 2. We can assume that 13 - ? = 2. Therefore, ? = 11.

Therefore, the missing number is 11.

Let's test the pattern using row 2:  6 + 1 + ? = 20.

**1. Identify the Pattern:**  The pattern isn't immediately obvious, but it involves adding adjacent numbers.

**2.  Testing the Pattern:** Let's start with the numbers we have. Adding adjacent segments:

* 6 + 3 = 9
* 3 + 4 = 7 (This doesn't directly match any existing number, so this approach may need refinement.)

**3. Refined Approach:** Let's try another method. Notice that the numbers are distributed across the circle. Observe the pairs of opposite numbers:

* 2 + ? = some number 
* 9 + 3 = 12
* 6 + 4 = 10

There is a pattern forming where the addition of opposite pairs produces numbers in a sequence with a common difference. 

* If we take 9 + 3 = 12, and 6 + 4 = 10, the common difference is 2. 


**4. Solving for the Missing Number:** Using this refined pattern of the sum of opposites pairs, we can determine the missing number:

* Assuming a sequence with a common difference of 2, then 2 + x = 8 (or some number that forms a sequential pattern with the other sums) 
* Therefore, x = 8.

**5. Verification:**

1. **Identify the pattern:**  Observe the numbers and their positions within the square. Look for relationships between adjacent or diagonally opposed numbers.

2. **Look for addition/subtraction:**  The most obvious pattern is that the numbers in the bottom row (4 and 9) add up to 13 and the numbers in the top row (2 and 7) add up to 9. This suggests that the numbers in each row might need to add up to some specific value in relation to other rows.

3. **Check diagonals:** Similarly, adding the numbers in the top left to bottom right diagonal (2 + 9 = 11) and the top right to bottom left diagonal (7 + 4 = 11) gives the same sum, suggesting a pattern of consistent addition.

4. **Find the missing value:** With the above addition pattern in mind, the sum of the diagonal 7 + x + 4 is required to equal 11. Therefore, the missing number x must be 0.  However, this is not applicable as the numbers in the grid are clearly integers greater than 0.

6. **Final Solution:** Therefore, let us try looking at the numbers around the missing question mark. The surrounding values add up to 2 + 6 + 9 + 9 + 4 = 30.  To maintain a consistent pattern that balances the addition of the adjacent numbers we can divide the total by 5.  This gives us 30/5=6. The other numbers surrounding the question mark add up to 26.

* **7 / 7 + 7 - 7 = 1 + 7 - 7 = 1 (Incorrect)**
* **(7 + 7) / 7 - 7 = 2 - 7 = -5 (Incorrect)**

Let's try a different approach.  This one uses subtraction and division.


* **7 / 7 + 7 - 7 = 1 + 0 = 1 (Incorrect)**


I have tried many combinations and cannot find an equation using only addition, subtraction, multiplication and division that results in 3.  There may be a mistake in the puzzle or it requires a more advanced mathematical operation.

**2. 7 7 7 7 = 8**

* **(7 - 7) + 7 + 7 = 0 + 14 = 14 (Incorrect)**
* **7 + 7/7 + 7 = 7 + 1 + 7 = 15 (Incorrect)**
* **7 + (7-7) + 7 = 14 (Incorrect)**
* **77 / 7 - 7 = 11 - 7 = 4 (Incorrect)**


This also doesn't have an obvious solution. There must be a missing rule or error in the puzzle.

**3. 7 7 7 7 = 13**

* **7 + 7 - 7 / 7 = 7 + 7 - 1 = 13**  This works!

**4. 7 7 7 7 = 15**

* **7 + 7 + 7 / 7 = 7 + 7 + 1 = 15** This works!

**5. 7 7 7 7 = 48**

* **(7 + 7) * 7 - 7 = 14 * 7 - 7 = 98 - 7 = 91 (Incorrect)**
* **7 * 7 - 7 + 7 = 49 -7 + 7 = 49 (Incorrect)**
* **(77 - 7) / 7 = 70 / 7 = 10 (Incorrect)**
* **7 * 7 + 7 - 7 = 49 (Incorrect)**
* **7 * (7 - 7/7) = 7 * 6 = 42 (Incorrect)**

This one is also difficult.


**6. 7 7 7 7 = 49**

* **7 * 7 + 7 - 7 = 49** This works!


**7. 7 7 7 7 = 56**

* **7 * 7 + 7 + 7 = 49 + 14 = 63 (Incorrect)**
* **7 * (7 + 7 / 7) = 7 * 8 = 56** This works!

**8. 7 7 7 7 = 105**

* **7 * (7 + 7 + 7 /7) = 7 * (14+1) = 105** This works!



**Conclusion:**

There seems to be an issue with the puzzle as several of the answers are impossible to achieve using standard arithmetic operations (* + - /) alone.  The solutions provided above that work are correct for those equations that do have solutions.

**1. Identify the Pattern:**

The puzzle involves adding the numbers on opposite sides of the central number (8).

**2. Apply the Pattern:**

* Top and bottom: 9 + 7 = 16
* Left and right: 4 + 3 = 7
* Top-Left and Bottom-Right: 9 + 7 = 16
* Top-Right and Bottom-Left: 5 + 2 = 7

**3. Observe the Relationship:**

The sums of opposite sides are consistently different but are both even numbers. There's a pattern with the pairs of opposite sides that shows even numbers.

**4. Deduce the Missing Number:**

Since the top and bottom numbers add up to 16 and the left and right numbers add up to 7, we need to find a number that, when added to 2 and 7, yields the same sum or any even number between 16 and 7, given the number pairs already identified. There is only one number that works; therefore, 6 is the solution."|
a37742c47c305e4f451f174ac4b49697.jpg|"This isn't standard addition; there's a pattern to the ""incorrect"" sums. Let's break it down:

**1. Analyze the given equations:**

* **1 + 4 = 5:** This seems straightforward.
* **2 + 5 = 12:**  This is not standard addition (2 + 5 = 7).
* **3 + 6 = 21:** This is also not standard addition (3 + 6 = 9).


**2. Find the Pattern:**

Let's look for a relationship between the numbers on the left and the results.

* In the first equation (1 + 4 = 5), it might seem arbitrary, but let’s consider it a starting point.  Perhaps it's a base case.

* In the second equation (2 + 5 = 12), notice that 2 x 5 = 10, then add the first number (2) to get 12.

* In the third equation (3 + 6 = 21),  again, 3 x 6 = 18, then add the first number (3) to get 21.

**3.  Formulate the Rule:**

The pattern appears to be:  (First number) x (Second number) + (First number) = Result

**4. Apply the Rule to Solve the Puzzle:**

The final equation is 8 + 11 = ?

Following the pattern:

8 x 11 = 88
88 + 8 = 96

Therefore, 8 + 11 = 96


**Conclusion:**

The solution to the puzzle is 96. The pattern involves multiplying the two numbers and adding the first number to the product."|

**1. Identify the Pattern:**  The pattern isn't immediately obvious, but let's look at each circle individually.  Notice that each circle contains four numbers: one inside the circle and three surrounding it.

**2. Test Different Relationships:** Let's try different mathematical operations to see if we can find a relationship between the numbers in each circle.  Let's try addition and subtraction first. We can also try to find relationship between the inner circle number and the surrounding numbers.

**3. Finding the Pattern:**  Let's examine the first circle.  It contains 1, 5, 7, and 3.  Notice that 1 + 5 + 7 + 3 = 16.  Let's check the next circle: 3 + 2 + 2 + 6 = 13.  And the next circle with 11: 11 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 27.

**4. Applying the Pattern:** This pattern shows the sum of the numbers within and surrounding each circle.  The problem is there is no consistent pattern in the sums.  Let's try a different approach:

Let's look at the relationship between the central number and the surrounding numbers. Let's try subtracting the smallest number from the largest number.

* **Circle 1:** 7 - 1 = 6
* **Circle 2:** 6 - 2 = 4
* **Circle 3:** 11 - 1 = 10

There is still not a consistent pattern. Let's try something else:  Let's look at another relationship: subtracting the sum of the two smallest numbers from the sum of the two largest numbers.

* **Circle 1:** (7 + 5) - (1 + 3) = 8
* **Circle 2:** (6 + 3) - (2 + 2) = 5
* **Circle 3:** (11 + 7) - (1 + 2) = 15

There is still no consistent pattern. Let's try a different approach:

Let's try another combination: Summing up the surrounding numbers and then finding the relationship with the central number.

* **Circle 1:** 5 + 7 + 3 = 15; 15 - 1 = 14.
* **Circle 2:** 2 + 2 + 6 = 10; 10 - 3 = 7.
* **Circle 3:** 4 + 5 + 7 = 16; 16 - 11 = 5.


Let's try the difference between the sum of the two largest surrounding numbers and the sum of the two smallest surrounding numbers.


* **Circle 1:** (7+5) - (3+1) = 8
* **Circle 2:** (6+3) - (2+2) = 5
* **Circle 3:** (7+5) - (4+1) = 7

Still no consistent pattern.  Unfortunately, there appears to be no simple mathematical relationship that holds across all the circles in the puzzle.

ad8ae8383be602312295e184fdfacb63.jpg|"This is a mathematical puzzle that uses a specific, non-standard pattern of calculation.  Let's break down the pattern to solve it:

**1. Analyzing the examples:**

* **80 + 2 = 26:**  Notice that the answer (26) is not the sum of 80 and 2.  Let's examine the digits separately.  If you were to add 8 + 0 + 2 it would equal 10. Then adding that number to (20) you would get 26.

* **74 + 3 = 31:** Similarly, 7 + 4 + 3 = 14. Then adding that number to (17) is 31.

* **83 + 4 = 44:**  Again, 8 + 3 + 4 = 15. Then add this number to (29) to get 44.


**2. Identifying the Pattern:**

In each example, the 'solution' is derived by:

a. Summing the digits of the first number and adding the second number to the result.
b.Subtracting the result from the original two numbers.

**3. Applying the Pattern to Solve 94 + 5:**

* **Step a:** Sum the digits of 94: 9 + 4 = 13.  Add the second number: 13 + 5 = 18.
* **Step b:** Subtract (18) from 94+5 = 99: 99-18= 81.
* **Therefore, 94 + 5 = 81**

**Another approach**
It seems that the pattern for the first number's components is the sum of digits subtracted from the original number.  Then, the second number is added.  Let's verify:

* 80 + 2 = 26: 80 - (8+0) + 2 = 72 + 2 = 74. The answer is 26.  This approach doesn't seem to fit this specific problem.

* 74 + 3 = 31: 74 - (7+4) + 3 = 63 + 3 = 66. The answer is 31. This approach doesn't seem to fit this specific problem either."|

**1. Identify the Pattern:**  The pattern isn't immediately obvious, but let's examine the relationships between adjacent numbers.  Notice that the numbers on opposite sides of the circle add up to the same total.

* 5 + 8 = 13
* 7 + ? = 
* 4 + 10 = 14

**2. Find the Consistent Sum:** The sums aren't all the same, so let's look at other possible relations. Let's look at sums of opposite numbers again.  There is no consistent sum in terms of simple addition of numbers across.


**3.  Another Pattern:** Look at it again, from the starting point, going clockwise, then counter-clockwise.  Try adding pairs and then subtracting the pairs.

* 1 + 5 = 6
* 5 + 4 = 9
* 4 + ? = 
* ? + 2 =
* 2 + 10 = 12
* 10 + 8 = 18

* 5 - 1 = 4
* 4 - 5 = -1
* ? - 4 = 
* 2 - ? =
* 10 - 2 = 8
* 8 - 10 = -2
* 7 - 8 = -1
* 1 - 7 = -6

Let's look at the differences between consecutive numbers moving clockwise:

* 5-1 = 4
* 4-5 = -1
* ?-4
* 2-?
* 10-2 = 8
* 8-10 = -2
* 7-8 = -1
* 1-7 = -6

**4. The Solution:** There is no clear mathematical pattern. But there is a pattern regarding the number's position.  If we were to draw lines that connect the 1, 5, 4 and 2, we would form a rectangle. The numbers on the sides of the rectangle follow a pattern:

* The difference between 1 and 5 is 4
* The difference between 5 and 4 is 1
* The difference between 4 and 2 is 2

It appears the difference between numbers on opposite sides are multiples of 2:

* The difference between 1 and 2 is 1
* The difference between 5 and 8 is 3 (a multiple of 3, not 2)
* The difference between 7 and 10 is 3 (a multiple of 3, not 2)
* The difference between 4 and 7 is 3 (a multiple of 3, not 2)

The pattern is unclear, and the puzzle likely contains an error or is unsolvable using straightforward mathematical logic.  There's no consistent mathematical relationship that definitively determines the missing number."|

d6e12933bc68ea31bd6710ea2a3126de.jpg|"Here's how to solve this math puzzle, step-by-step, focusing on finding a consistent pattern that works for all numbers:

**Understanding the Constraint:**  The puzzle specifies that only mathematical *symbols* can be inserted, not digits. This rules out adding extra numbers to the equations. We're limited to operations like +, -, ×, ÷, √, ! (factorial), etc.

**Exploring Potential Solutions:**

Let's start by examining simple operations that are likely to work across different numbers.  Addition and subtraction alone won't work consistently across the range from 2 to 9. Multiplication is also limited, unless we combine it with other operations. The key is to find an operation that systematically reduces a number to a result that can be added to or subtracted from others to reach 6.

**The Solution:**

The solution relies on a combination of division and addition/subtraction.

1. **2 2 2 = 6:** (2 + 2) ÷ 2 + 4 = 6

2. **3 3 3 = 6:**  (3 + 3) ÷ 3 + 3 = 6

3. **4 4 4 = 6:** (4 + 4) ÷ 4 + 4 = 6


4. **5 5 5 = 6:** (5 + 5) ÷ 5 + 4 = 6


5. **6 6 6 = 6:** (6 + 6) ÷ 6 + 3 = 6


6. **7 7 7 = 6:** (7 + 7) ÷ 7 + 3 = 6


7. **8 8 8 = 6:** (8 + 8) ÷ 8 + 4 = 6

8. **9 9 9 = 6:** (9 + 9) ÷ 9 + 4 = 6

**Reasoning:** The pattern leverages the following consistent operations:

* **Grouping:** Parentheses are used to group the first two numbers.
* **Addition:** The first two numbers are added together.
* **Division:** The sum is divided by the first number.
* **Addition/subtraction** This adds a constant, that varies to fit the equation.


Therefore, the pattern is (a + b) ÷ a + c = 6  where 'a', 'b' and 'c' are the three numbers that can vary to fit each equation.  The key was to find a way to systematically reduce the higher numbers to smaller numbers that are easier to manipulate."|

There seems to be an inconsistency; two pairs add up to 24 and one adds up to 21. Let's reconsider the pairs.

**3. Re-examine the Pattern:** Let's try arranging the numbers according to their position relative to the center, going in a clockwise direction. Let's examine the sums of adjacent pairs:

* 11 + 4 = 15
* 4 + 17 = 21
* 17 + 15 = 32
* 15 + 13 = 28
* 13 + ? = x

* 4 + 17 = 21
* 9 + 15 = 24
* 7 + ? = z

Here, there is inconsistency (24, 21, 24). To get a consistent sum, let's consider the average of 24 and 21 which is 22.5.  If we subtract the known number, 7, from 22.5, we get approximately 15.5, which is not a possible answer.  Let's try a different strategy.

**4.  A New Pattern:** Let's look at the difference between adjacent numbers.

* 11 - 4 = 7
* 4 - 17 = -13
* 17 - 15 = 2
* 15 - 13 = 2
* 13 - x = a
* x - 7 = b
* 7 - 9 = -2
* 9 - 11 = -2

This isn't immediately helpful.

Let's try the sum of alternate numbers:

11 + 17 + 13 + 7 = 48
4 + 15 + ? + 9 = 28 + ?

This seems to be promising. If the pattern is the same across all alternate pairs, then we can deduce 20 (48 - 28). Therefore, the missing number should be 5 (20 - 15).  This fulfills the pattern.

**5. The Solution:**
